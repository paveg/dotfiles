- [ ] Implement backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Provide rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Create user data preservation tools

## Phase 6: Advanced Features
### 🚀 Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] Implement secrets management
  - [ ] 1Password integration
  - [ ] Environment-specific secrets
  - [ ] Secure template variables
- [ ] Add machine-specific configurations
  - [ ] Work vs personal environments
  - [ ] Hardware-specific optimizations
  - [ ] Network-aware configurations

### 🔧 Maintenance Tools
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Configuration drift detection
- [ ] Health check utilities
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration

## Success Criteria
### ✅ Functional Requirements
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux/Windows WSL)
- [ ] Maintain current shell performance (<150ms startup)
- [ ] Preserve all existing functionality
- [ ] Automated testing coverage >90%

### 🎯 Quality Requirements
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with multi-platform testing
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Easy migration path from current setup
- [ ] Rollback capabilities

### 📊 Performance Requirements
- [ ] Shell startup time ≤ current performance
- [ ] Installation time < 5 minutes on all platforms
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completion < 10 minutes
- [ ] Zero manual intervention for standard setups

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
### ⚠️ High-Risk Items
- [ ] Performance regression during migration
  - Mitigation: Continuous performance monitoring
- [ ] Platform-specific feature loss
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing matrix
- [ ] User workflow disruption
  - Mitigation: Gradual migration with fallbacks

### 🔄 Rollback Plan
- [ ] Maintain current dotfiles as backup branch
- [ ] Implement quick restore mechanisms
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 weeks (Analysis + Core Migration)
