# Zsh Completion Enhancements

This document summarizes the comprehensive completion enhancements added to the zinit plugin configuration.

## Overview

The completion system has been significantly enhanced to support all installed tools while maintaining the existing performance optimization strategy. The enhancements follow the established patterns in the codebase.

## Completion Loading Strategy

### Timing Levels

- **wait"0"**: Core completions (syntax highlighting, basic completions)
- **wait"2"**: Standard development tools and utilities
- **wait"3"**: Heavy tools (cloud tools, tools with lazy loading conflicts)

### Safety Features

- All completions check for tool existence before loading
- Graceful fallbacks for missing tools
- No startup penalties for uninstalled tools

## Added Completions by Category

### Currently Installed Tools

#### Kubernetes & Container Tools

- `kubectl` - Kubernetes command line tool
- `docker` - Container runtime

#### Rust Development Tools

- `cargo` / `rustc` / `rust-analyzer` - Rust toolchain (via rustup)
- `just` - Command runner and build tool
- `tokei` - Code statistics tool
- `hyperfine` - Benchmarking tool
- `dust` - Disk usage analyzer
- `procs` - Process viewer
- `sd` - Search and replace tool

#### Go Development

- `go` - Go programming language tools

#### Node.js Tools

- `pnpm` - Fast package manager (already configured)

#### Development Environment Tools

- `deno` - Modern JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- `flyctl` - Fly.io deployment tool

#### Utility Tools

- `protoc` - Protocol Buffer compiler
- `grpcurl` - gRPC command line tool
- `lazygit` - Git TUI (already configured)
- `lazydocker` - Docker TUI
- `mas` - macOS App Store CLI
- `navi` - Interactive cheat sheet tool
- `jq` - JSON processor

#### Package Managers

- `brew` - macOS package manager (enhanced)

### Future-Proofed Completions

#### Cloud Tools (for work environments)

- `aws` - AWS CLI
- `saml2aws` - SAML-based AWS authentication
- `helm` - Kubernetes package manager
- `terraform` - Infrastructure as Code
- `k9s` - Kubernetes TUI

#### Modern CLI Tools (when installed)

- `starship` - Cross-shell prompt
- `atuin` - Shell history replacement (already configured)
- `zoxide` - Smart directory jumper
- `broot` - Tree-like file manager
- `zellij` - Terminal multiplexer
- `bat` - Cat replacement with syntax highlighting
- `ripgrep` (`rg`) - Fast grep replacement
- `fd` - Fast find replacement
- `eza` - Modern ls replacement (already configured)

#### Ruby/Rails Development

- `bundle` - Ruby dependency manager
- `rails` - Ruby on Rails framework

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading Integration

- Respects existing lazy loading patterns for `mise` and `atuin`
- Cloud tools delayed to `wait"3"` to avoid conflicts
- Heavy completions loaded after core shell functionality

### Error Handling

- All completions wrapped in existence checks
- No startup failures for missing tools
- Graceful degradation when tools are unavailable

### Memory Optimization

- Uses zinit's turbo mode for deferred loading
- Completion caching via existing zstyle configuration
- Minimal startup impact through strategic timing

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### XDG Compliance

- Completion cache stored in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zsh/`
- Follows established directory structure

### Module Dependencies

- Builds on existing `platform.zsh` utilities
- Uses `is_exist_command` pattern from alias.zsh
- Integrates with core completion system in `core.zsh`

### Business/Personal Environment Support

- Cloud tools ready for business environment
- Personal development tools prioritized
- Conditional loading based on tool availability

## Maintenance

### Adding New Completions

1. Determine appropriate timing level (wait"0", wait"2", or wait"3")
1. Add existence check with `command -v`
1. Use appropriate completion method:

- `eval "$(tool completion zsh)"` for dynamic completions
- `complete -W "options" tool` for simple static completions

1. Follow existing patterns for consistency

### Tool-Specific Notes

- Tools with lazy loading (mise, atuin) use `wait"3"` to avoid conflicts
- Cloud tools grouped together for work environment activation
- Rust tools leverage native completion support where available
- Package managers enhance existing fpath integration

## Testing

To test the completions after applying changes:

1. Restart zsh or run `source ~/.zshrc`
1. Test specific completions: `tool <TAB>`
1. Check startup performance: `zshtime` or `ZPROFILER=1 zsh`
1. Verify no errors in completion loading

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:

- Language-specific completions (Python, Ruby, Java tools)
- IDE/Editor tool completions (nvim plugins, VS Code CLI)
- Database tool completions (PostgreSQL, MySQL clients)
- Monitoring tool completions (Prometheus, Grafana utilities)
